## Quarto

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished document. To learn more about Quarto see <https://quarto.org>.

## Running Code

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

```{r}
1 + 1
```

You can add options to executable code like this

```{r}
#| echo: false
2 * 2
```

The `echo: false` option disables the printing of code (only output is displayed).

Question 1
a
```{r}
file_path <- "./abalone/abalone.data"
abalone <- read.table(file_path, sep = ",")
abalone.names <- c("Sex", "Length", "Diameter","Height","Whole weight","ShuckedWeight", "VisceraWeight", "ShellWeight", "Rings")
colnames(abalone) <- abalone.names
```

b
```{r}
table(abalone$Sex)
```

c.1.
The Shell Weight has the highest correlation with Rings
```{r}
cor(abalone$ShuckedWeight, abalone$Rings)
cor(abalone$VisceraWeight, abalone$Rings)
cor(abalone$ShellWeight, abalone$Rings)
```

c.2.
The Male has a higher correlation of Shell Weight with Rings.
```{r}
sub_F <- abalone[abalone$Sex == "F",]
sub_I <- abalone[abalone$Sex == "M",]
sub_M <- abalone[abalone$Sex == "I",]
cor(sub_F$ShellWeight, sub_F$Rings)
cor(sub_I$ShellWeight, sub_I$Rings)
cor(sub_M$ShellWeight, sub_M$Rings)
```
